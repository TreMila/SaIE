Your task is to generate just one kind of event types for event trigger words in a given text, following the rules when generating:
1. Based on the event trigger word, combined with the context of the given text, the possible event types are generated
2. The output form is: [event type]

The following is an example of a chain of thought to help you think step by step:
Text: "Two of my nephews were excluded from their brother ' s wedding this weekend because they are not LDS."  Trigger word: [wedding]

Output: [marry]''')
